# Neural Radiance Fields (Re-Implementation)

This repository implements a minimal training and inference package around Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). See the original paper "NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis," by Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng at ECCV 2020.
